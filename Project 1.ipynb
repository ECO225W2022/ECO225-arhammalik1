    "# Introduction \n",
    "With the use of high school data compiled from the New York City Department of Education, and the SAT score averages and testing rates provided by the College Board, we analyse and discuss whether a student's high school and borrough affects the SAT score he gets through college board. SAT scores are standardized tests taken by the college board (an independent board) that are used by students to apply for college after highschool. The score a child gets greatly impacts his/her chance in getting into college and their future. Though the new SAT tests have changed their format to 1600 points (Math: 800, Reading: 400, Writing: 400), however, we will be using data from the older format which gives us almost the same results (Math: 800, Reading: 800, Writing: 800). The main emphasis in the project is to find connections in whether some boroughs or highschools in New York City do better than others and discuss the factors that lead to these differences. Finding differences would be extremely interesting as one can infer how getting into certain public highschools or going for schooling in certain areas of the city would impact the college a child gets into. \n"

    "Our data is very comprehensive, and to answer our question: (Y Variable) whether borough or high school impact the SAT score a child gets, we will use different variables. One of our variable (X_1) will be borough, the second will be Average SAT Reading Scores (X_2), Average SAT Math Scores (X_3), Average SAT Reading Scores (X_4). With the use of these variables we will try to develop an analysis on whether the borough you live in around NYC would give certain students a natural advantage. "
